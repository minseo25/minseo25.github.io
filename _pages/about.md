Hi, I'm an undergraduate student at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/) majoring in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.snu.ac.kr/en). My research focuses on improving the efficiency of large-scale AI models grounded in a deep understanding of systems.
I aim to achieve this by developing system-aware algorithmic methods and cross-stack designs that enable efficient training and serving in real-world deployments.
Currently, I am working on inference efficiency for large language models (LLMs) and diffusion language models (DLMs).

During my undergraduate years, I have been fortunate to be part of two great research groups. I am currently a visiting researcher in the Pallas Lab at [Berkeley AI Research (BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Prof. Kurt Keutzer](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~keutzer/) and [Dr. Amir Gholami](https://amirgholami.org/). Previously, I worked in the [Architecture and Code Optimization Lab (ARC Lab)](https://arc.snu.ac.kr/) at Seoul National University, advised by [Prof. Jae W. Lee](https://iamjaelee.github.io/www/).

<b>I am seeking a PhD position starting in Fall 2026.</b>
